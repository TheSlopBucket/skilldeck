# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The project version
(`pyproject.toml`) tracks the installer; individual skills carry their own
`version` in `meta.yaml`, noted below.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-27

### Security

- The Claude adapter now serializes skill frontmatter with `yaml.safe_dump`
  instead of string interpolation, so a name/description containing newlines or
  YAML metacharacters cannot inject extra frontmatter keys into the rendered
  `SKILL.md`.
- `install` refuses to write through a symlink at the destination, preventing a
  pre-placed symlink from redirecting the write to an arbitrary file.
- Dropped Python 3.9 support (`requires-python` now `>=3.10`) to resolve
  Dependabot alert GHSA-6w46-j5rx-g56g / CVE-2025-71176 (pytest insecure tmpdir
  handling): the fix lands only in pytest 9.0.3+, which requires Python 3.10+,
  so the 3.9 test matrix was the sole remaining resolution pinning a vulnerable
  pytest. Python 3.9 reached end-of-life in October 2025. The dev `pytest` floor
  is now `>=9.0.3`; the CI matrix and trove classifiers are 3.10–3.14.

### Added

- Continuous integration (GitHub Actions): ruff lint/format, mypy (strict on
  `src`), a pytest matrix across Python 3.9–3.14, and a build check that the
  skills are bundled into the wheel.
- Release workflow that publishes to PyPI via Trusted Publishing (OIDC) on
  version tags.
- `logging` skill (0.1.0) — guidance for adding and reviewing application
  logging following the OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet.
- `code-smells` skill (0.1.0) — reviews pending changes for code smells
  (refactoring.guru catalog) and suggests refactorings.
- `dependency-review` skill (0.1.0) — reviews dependency/lockfile changes for
  known vulnerabilities and supply-chain risk (OWASP A06, ASVS V15).
- `test-review` skill (0.1.0) — reviews pending changes for adequate, meaningful
  test coverage and flags weak, misleading, or flaky tests.
- `docs/finding-output.md` — canonical finding format shared by all review
  skills, so findings can be sorted, deduplicated, and posted as PR comments
  without per-skill parsing; referenced from `docs/authoring-skills.md`.

### Changed

- **Renamed the project `skillful` → `skilldeck`** to avoid a PyPI name
  collision with an unrelated package. The distribution, `import` package, and
  console command are all now `skilldeck` (e.g. `uvx skilldeck`,
  `skilldeck list`).
- `security-review` skill (0.1.0 → 0.2.0) — review checklist realigned to the
  OWASP ASVS 5.0 categories (V1–V16) with assurance levels (L2 default); findings
  now include an ASVS category.
- `security-review` skill (0.2.0 → 0.2.1) — added the ASVS 5.0 **V17 WebRTC**
  category (scoped to changes that touch WebRTC).
- `code-smells` skill (0.1.0 → 0.1.1) — added the **Incomplete Library Class**
  coupler smell to complete the refactoring.guru catalog.
- `logging` skill (0.1.0 → 0.1.1) — added OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet guidance on
  synchronizing time across sources and protecting log integrity (tamper-evident,
  append-only storage; restricted access).
- All review skills (`security-review` 0.2.1 → 0.2.2, `code-smells` 0.1.1 →
  0.1.2, `logging` 0.1.1 → 0.1.2, `dependency-review` 0.1.0 → 0.1.1, `test-review`
  0.1.0 → 0.1.1) — conformed every `## Output` section to the shared finding
  format (`[severity] classifier — location` + Issue + Fix) documented in
  `docs/finding-output.md`.
- `skilldeck list` groups skills by category (the `category` field was previously
  required but never surfaced).
- `install`/`uninstall` no longer re-parse every skill once per requested name;
  skills are discovered a single time per invocation.
- Filled out packaging metadata for PyPI (authors, keywords, trove classifiers,
  project URLs) and fixed the stale `Skillful` copyright in `LICENSE`.

### Fixed

- The installed `skilldeck` console command now routes through `main()`, so a
  malformed skill reports a clean `error: …` message instead of a traceback (the
  entry point previously bypassed the error handler).
- `uninstall` removes the now-empty per-skill directory it created (e.g. Claude's
  `.claude/skills/<name>/`) instead of leaving it behind; shared directories are
  left untouched.
- `Skill` is now hashable (its `supported-agents` is stored as a tuple), so the
  frozen dataclass can be used in sets and as dict keys.
- `supported-agents` entries are validated against the known adapters at the CLI
  boundary; a typo'd agent name now fails loudly instead of silently never
  installing.
- Updated stale `Skillful` references to `skilldeck` and made package metadata the
  single source of truth for the version (dropped the duplicated `__version__`
  literal).

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Initial `skilldeck` CLI: `list`, `install`, `uninstall`.
- Agent adapters for Claude, Codex, and Kiro.
- `security-review` skill (0.1.0).
